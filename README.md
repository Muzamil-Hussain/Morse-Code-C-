# Morse-Code-C-
C++ code for implementation of morse code



Morse code has been one of the most basic communication protocol and still used to convey SOS messages and other urgent communication. In Morse code each English alphabet is encoded by a sequence of ’.’ and ’-’, see Figure 1 for complete mapping between English alphabets and Morse codes. This program can, 

(i) convert any given string into a Morse code sequence.
(ii) a morse code sequence to string.
